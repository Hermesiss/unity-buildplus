## Installation

### OpenUPM

This is the easiest way and you can update to new versions quickly: [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/trismegistus.unity.buildplus/)

### From git URL

- Open package manager
- Select Plus -> From git URL
- Paste `https://github.com/Hermesiss/unity-buildplus.git?path=/Packages/trismegistus.unity.buildplus`
- Press install

## Add your own build path parameters

You can see example usage in `StandardBuildParameters`

1. Create static method with `PathParameter` return type and no arguments. Only in Editor class
1. Add `[BuildPathProvider]` attribute to class
1. Add `[BuildPath]` attribute to method
1. Construct proper `PathParameter`

This method will be called on opening Build+ window, saving, building or pressing "Refresh".

## Readme from creator

Build+ can help you to version your app in a straight-forward way and avoid some of the headaches with maintaining release notes outside of the development environment. With Build+ you can even include your release notes in the app itself! As Build+ evolves, additional useful features will be added to automating your builds.

Launch Build+ by selecting `File->Build+...`

When you save you'll see a \_BuildPlus.xml and a \_BuildPlus.asset added to the root of your Assets/ folder. The xml is used only for easy merging. The asset file is a binary serialized version that you can use directly in your app for showing the version number/release notes. An example of this is shown in `BuildPlus/Example/Example.unity`.

Suggested workflow:

1. All developers on the team can add their significant changes to the release notes and check in the `_BuildPlus.xml/asset` along with the changed files. This should be done at the current version shown in Build+.
2. When a build is made and released, the developer who makes the build should increment the version number and check in `_BuildPlus.xml/asset`, so that other developers know where new notes should go.

ReleaseNotes.txt:  
After you have made a single build using the standard Build menu, you can then use Build+ to make additional builds
using the previously used settings. When you build this way, you will see a ReleaseNotes.txt file alongside your build.

Please send any feedback to <buildplus@luminaryproductions.net>.

Enjoy!
